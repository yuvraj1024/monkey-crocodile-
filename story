STORY

Once upon a time, a clever monkey lived on a berry tree, on the banks of a river. In the same forest lived a crocodile and his wife. 
One day, the crocodile wanders deep into the river and comes to rest under the berry tree, on which the monkey lived.

The crocodile, having swum up quite a distance, was tired and hungry.
The kind monkey sees that the crocodile is hungry and shares the berries with the crocodile. 
The crocodile eats the sweet berries, thanks the monkey, and goes back home.

The crocodile, having enjoyed the sweet berries that the monkey shared, goes back to the tree the next day. 
The monkey happily shares the fruits from the tree. 
They spend the entire day talking and eating berries. Soon, the monkey and the crocodile became good friends and began to trust each other.
